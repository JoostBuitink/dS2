# Introduction

dS2 is a distributed hydrological model, based on the model defined by 
Kirchner (2009). The model assumes that the simulated discharge is solely 
dependent on the storage of that particular area. This model allows the user
to apply this concept in a distributed fashion, where the spatial resolution 
is determined by the input files. The temporal resolution can be modified by the
user as well.

# Requirements

- Python 3.6, including basic libraries, such as: datetime, glob, os, pickle
- NumPy (1.16.2)
- pandas (0.24.1)
- xarray (0.11.3)
- tqdm (4.31.1)

# Notes

All forcing input files should be entered as mm h-1, even if a coarser temporal
resolution is used. 

# Input

Both input and output directories can be relative to the current model path, or 
direct to another directory using the full path name.
