def snowmelt_potential(T, Rg, T0, ddf, fact):
    """
    Calculate the potential snowmelt for each chunk of forcing data, where the
    melt is not corrected for the current snow storage (this is done in the
    dynamic loop of the model). Snowmelt is the cumulative snowmelt during each
    time step, and not an intensitiy. Function is based on [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : numpy array
        Array containing the air temperature of each model cell for that specific
        timestep
    Rg : numpy array
        Array containing the global radiation of each model cell for that
        specific timestep
    T0 : float
        Critical temperature, above which snow will melt
    ddf : float
        Degree day factor
    fact : float
        Conversion factor from W/m2 to mm/hour (0.026 as default)
